============

## Education


2015-2019 (expected)
:   **BS, Computer Science**; Bridgewater State University


## Academic Experience

**Adrian Tinsley Program, PogChamp, Summer 2017**

Worked with my mentor Dr. Oussa on using wavelet-based modeling techniques to find trends and behavior in Twitch.tv chat logs to infer the location of highlights in a livestream


**Directed Study, Automatic Frog Vocalization Detection, Spring 2018**

Working with my mentor Dr. Black on using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques to determine particular frog species’ vocalizations in audio recordings. Techniques used include Fourier Transforms, Spectral Peak Track feature extraction, and Mel-frequency Cepstrum.

## Projects

**Skyrim** Calculate the combination of ingredients to discover all the effects for all the ingredients.

**Blaise** A Mini-Pascal compiler I am creating to teach myself the fundementals of compiler design.

## Hackathons

**HackHarvard:** Went with my team from Bridgewater and created a iOS Password Manager

**HackPrinceton:** Worked with two students from University of Toronto to use machine learning to determine the location of highlights in a twitch stream

## Skills Highlight

Leadership
:  **President of the Computer Science Club**: I took over the role this year and have organized trips to hackathons, competed in regional programming competitions, and brought in outside speakers in our industry.

Programming Languages
:   **Python:** The glue language that holds everything together for me. If I need something prototyped quickly without concern for speed or space efficiency I jump to Python.

:   **Go:** If the going gets hard and I need to build up a well defined, possibly concurrent system I use Go. With it’s wonderful parallel processing primitives and flexible type system it is a joy to work with.

:   **Rust:** From compilers to hard real-time **Rust** gives me the power to control the lifetime of every object and the promises to behave.

:   I am also knowledgable in **Scala**, **C/C\+\+**, **Haskell**, and **Bash/ZSH**
